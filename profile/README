The `aurelian-one` Github organization contains projects for the Aurelian task-tracking toolkit.

The Aurelian tools support client-first and peer-to-peer tracking without relying on cloud services to function.

While Aurelian is an open-source project, unfortunately it is closed to code contributions at this time. If you have feedback, or want to file an issue or suggestion, please create an issue in the associated project.
